# DHT
A DHT project from CMPT 371(FALL 2015)

A distributed hash table (DHT) is a class of a decentralized distributed system that provides a lookup service similar to a hash table: (key, value) pairs are stored in a DHT, and any participating node can efficiently retrieve the value associated with a given key. 

The structure of a DHT can be decomposed into several main components including a keyspace, a keyspace partitioning and an overlay network.
